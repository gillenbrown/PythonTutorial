      "This will be an introduction to using IPython notebooks. [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) are a way of combining text, code, and images/figures that is very useful for quick computations, testing code, and developing plots that runs in a web brower. It can make things very compact, since it is possible to combine code, figures, and text about the results of the code all in one file that can be either run interactively by others or viewed online via [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key features that make it useful:\n",
      "* Interactive code that remembers history. Chunks of code can be written and run whenever, and you don't need to rewrite snippets to rerun them. This makes testing very easy and efficient.\n",
      "* Inline matplotlib plots. The plots can be displayed right in the web browser. Changes are very easy to make, since we just change the code and see our results right there. \n",

      "## Installing IPython \n",
      "\n",
      "If you already have `pip` installed (and you should, it's awesome!), IPython notebook installation is very easy. Just call `pip install \"ipython[notebook]\"` from the command line. This will also install any dependencies you don't have. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you have something like Anaconda or Canopy, there is a good change you already have IPython notebooks installed. You might want to make sure it is updated to the latest version, though.\n",

      "From a terminal window, simply call `ipython notebook`. It will launch your browser, and display the file structure of the folder from which you typed the command. Navigate to wherever you want to make the notebook file, then click new notebook at the top right corner. Your window should look something like this:\n",

If you are viewing this in nbviewer, try getting this tutorial to run on your machine. Go to the [GitHub page for this tutorial](https://github.com/gillenbrown/PythonTutorial) and sync it to your machine. If you have GitHub you can clone it to your desktop, or just download a .zip. Buttons for both of these options are in the bottom right of the page.\n",

Try double clicking on this text to see the formatting for this cell, then press `shift+enter` to turn it back into display mode.

      "What really makes IPython notebooks shine is their ability to rerun cells. Try changing the range of the loop above, and re-running the cell. `x` changes each time, and any changes in `x` are reflected in any later calculations we wanted to do with `x`. This is so useful because we can make slight changes to our code, and see the changes.
